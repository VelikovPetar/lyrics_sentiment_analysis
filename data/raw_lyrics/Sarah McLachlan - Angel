Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay


There's always some reason
To feel not good enough

And it's hard at the end of the day



I need some distraction

Oh, beautiful release

Memory seeps through my veins



Let me be empty

Oh weightless and maybe

I'll find some peace tonight



In the arms of the angel

Fly away from here

From this dark cold hotel room

And the endlessness that you feel

You are pulled from the wreckage

Of your silent reverie

You're in the arms of the angel

May you find some comfort here



So tired of the straight line

And everywhere you turn

There's vultures and thieves at your back



The storm keeps on twisting

Keep on building the lies

That you make up for all that you lack



Don't make no difference

Escape one last time

It's easier to believe in this sweet maddness

Oh, this glorious sadness

That brings me to my knees



In the arms of the angel

Fly away from here

From this dark cold hotel room

And the endlessness that you feel

You are pulled from the wreckage

Of your silent reverie

Your in the arms of the angel

May you find some comfort here



Your in the arms of the angel

May you find some comfort here
