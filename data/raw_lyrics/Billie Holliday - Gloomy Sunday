Sunday is gloomy.
My hours are slumberless.
Dearest the shadows I live with are numberless.

Little white flowers 
Will never awaken you,
Not where the black coach of sorrow has taken you.

Angels have no thought

Of ever returning you.

Would they be angry if I thought of joining you?

Gloomy Sunday.



Gloomy is Sunday.

With shadows I spend it all.

My heart and I have decided to end it all.

Soon there'll be candles and prayers that are sad I know.

Let them not weep.

Let them know that I'm glad to go.

Death is no dream

For in death I'm caressin' you.

With the last breath of my soul,

I'll be blessin' you.

Gloomy Sunday.



Dreaming,

I was only dreaming.

I wake and I find you asleep in the deep of my heart.



Darling I hope that my dream never haunted you.

My heart is telling you

How much I wanted you.

Gloomy Sunday.
