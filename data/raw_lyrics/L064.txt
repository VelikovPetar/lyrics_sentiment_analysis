I'm coming down to see ya, I'm looking for fast and cheap
I'm looking for the black moon streets (yeah-ow)
I'm gonna get experience, I came to see the candy man
To turn it up and drown (he said...)

Feels just like it should (yeah-ow), feels just like it should (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should, I'm gonna get experience (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should, turn it up and drown

I'm coming out with laser beams to shoot some cherries down
I took a little free agent, I got myself a five-mile smile
So, baby, for the first time, I need a little sugar-spice (yeah-ow)
I wanna see the city lights, I'm gonna find a lover (she said...)

Feels just like it should (yeah-ow), feels just like it should (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should, I'm looking for the fast and cheap
Feels just like it should, I'm looking for the black moon streets (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should, I'm gonna get experience (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should, I'm here to see the candy man (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should

Sugar-spice, I'm on the phone, I'm outside
I need a little sexfunk a-right now
I want you, I wanna lick you up and down
Feels good, you said it would feel that good and it does
(Yeah-ow, yeah-ow) And it feels, it feels, it feels
And it feels, it feels, it feels, and it feels, it feels, it feels
Just like you... A-just like you said it would (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should (yeah-ow)
Feels just like it should, I'm coming out tonight to taste your
Sugar-spice, I want you, a sexy girl, slips in, it feels good
(I love it when you tell me) Feels just like it should
