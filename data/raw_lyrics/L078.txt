For everything you do, I'd like to swallow you
And everyday I'm gonna blame you 
Even if you justify every fucking bullshit lie, it only makes me want to break you 


You pull me down and you crucify my name, you make me insane 
It's broken now, don't ever look my way, don't even think I'm playing 

'Cause 

I fuckin' hate you 

You're such a liar 

I'd love to hang you 

You're all the same to me 



When you repeatedly take advantage of me 

The only thought I get of you sickens me 

Everybody knows you're fake 

You're everything I fucking hate 

And I'm everything that you could never be 



You pull me down and you crucify my name, you make me insane 

It's broken now, don't ever look my way, don't even think I'm playing 

'Cause 

I fuckin' hate you 

You're such a liar 

I'd love to hang you 

You're all the same to me 



I fuckin' hate you 

You're such a liar 

I'd love to hang you 

You're all the same to me 

fuck you 

fuck you 

fuck you 

fuck you 



You pull me down and you crucify my name, you make me insane 

It's broken now, don't ever look my way, don't even think I'm playing 

'Cause 

I fuckin' hate you 

You're such a liar 

I'd love to hang you 

You're all the same to me 



I fuckin' hate you 

You're such a liar 

I'd love to hang you 

You're all the same to me 

fuck you 

fuck you 

fuck you 

fuck you
