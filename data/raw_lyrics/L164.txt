There comes a time 
When we head a certain call 
When the world must come together as one 

There are people dying 
And it's time to lend a hand to life 
The greatest gift of all 

We can't go on 

Pretending day by day 

That someone, somewhere will soon make a change 

We are all a part of 

God's great big family 

And the truth, you know love is all we need 

We are the world 

We are the children 

We are the ones who make a better day 

So let's start giving 

There's a choice we're making 

We're saving our own lives 

It's true we'll make a better day 

Just you and me 

Send them your heart 

So they'll know that someone cares 

And their lives will be stronger and free 

As God has shown us, love's the only way

So we all must lend a helping hand 

We are the world 

We are the children 

We are the ones who make a brighter day 

So let's start giving 

There's a choice we're making 

We're saving our own lives 

It's true we'll make a better day 

Just you and me 

When you're down and out 

There seems no hope at all 

But if you just believe 

There's no way we can fall 

Let us realize 

That a change will only come 

When we stand together as one 

We are the world 

We are the children 

We are the ones who make a brighter day 

So let's start giving 

There's a choice we're making 

We're saving our own lives 

It's true we'll make a better day 

Just you and me

We are the world 

We are the children 

We are the ones who make a brighter day 

So let's start giving 

There's a choice we're making 

We're saving our own lives 

It's true we'll make a better day 

Just you and me

We are the world 

We are the children 

We are the ones who make a brighter day 

So let's start giving 

There's a choice we're making 

We're saving our own lives 

It's true we'll make a better day 

Just you and me

We are the world 

We are the children 

We are the ones who make a brighter day 

So let's start giving 

There's a choice we're making 

We're saving our own lives 

It's true we'll make a better day 

Just you and me
