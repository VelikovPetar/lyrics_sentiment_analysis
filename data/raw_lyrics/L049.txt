I rock a nigga to sleep
Roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby
Roc-roc-roc-a-bye baby

You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (Nigga I say dead, you dead)
You should be dead by now
Smile but wait until my shooters come round
With the talons and hollow tip rounds
In my hood they know how I be down (Nigga I say dead, you dead)

Yeah I show you my teeth all through the beef
Paint the sidewalk red with the back of your head
Shootouts in my hood like a daily routine
D's think I'm involved when a nigga hit hard
So when that hammer hit the shell and the hollow tip fly
Nigga you can cross your heart and hope not to die
Come through squash the drama, send niggas with llamas
To heat your ass up fuck being masked up
I was given the gift of life
From Sabrina since then I've been jammed up and bucked with the nina
Nana raised nine kids I turned out the meanest
I mean a menace
Fuck with me and your finished
