Come on, step inside, and you will realize.
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be.
What you envision you'll see -- what do you expect of me?

I can't live this... lie. 
Hate! I sing my words, I've thought that feeling,
with your life's dead bodies everywhere.

You really want me to be a good son.

Why? You make me feel like no one. 



Let me strip the plain, let me not give in.

Free me of your life, inside my heart dies.

Your dreams, never I'll achieve, don't lay that shit on me.

Let me live my... life. 



Hate! I sing my words, I've thought that feeling,

with your life's dead bodies everywhere.

You really want me to be a good son.

Why? You make me feel like no one. 



You want me to be, something I can never ever be! (x2) 



I sing my words, I thought that didn't,

with your life's dead bodies everywhere.

You really want me to be a good son.

Why? You make me feel like no one. 



Dead bodies everywhere! (x8)
