let me sail, let me sail, let the orinoco flow,
let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli.
let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore,

let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea.
Sail away, sail away, sail away,

Sail away, sail away, sail away,

sail away, sail away, sail away, 

sail away, sail away, sail away.(Chor)



from Bissau to Palau - in the shade of Avalon,

from Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony,

from Peru to Cebu feal the power of Babylon,

from Bali to Cali - far beneath the Coral Sea.



Sail away, sail away, sail away,

Sail away, sail away, sail away,

sail away, sail away, sail away, 

sail away, sail away, sail away.(Chor)



from the North to the South, Ebudae onto Khartoum,

from the deep sea of Clouds to the island of the moon,

carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been,

carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen.



we can sail, we can sail...

with the orinoco flow

we can sail, we can sail...



sail away, sail away, sail away.(Chor)



we can steer, we can near with Rob Dickins at the wheel,

we can sigh, say goodbye Ross and his dependencies

we can sail, we can sail...



sail away, sail away, sail away.(Chor)



we can reach, we can beach on the shores of Tripoli.

we can sail, we can sail...



sail away, sail away, sail away.(Chor)



from Bali to Cali - far beneath the Coral Sea.

we can sail, we can sail...



sail away, sail away, sail away.(Chor)5x
