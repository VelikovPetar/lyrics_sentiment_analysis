Somewhere
in a winter night
the angels

begin their flight;
dark skies
with miles to go,

no footsteps

to be lost in snow.



They fly to you

Oh, new-born king

They fly to you

Oh, angels sing



one is sorrow

one is peace

one will come

to give you sleep

one is comfort

one is grief

one will take

the tears you weep



New star

in a midnight sky

in heaven

all the angels fly

soft wings so true

and all things

they will give to you



Somewhere

in a winter night

the angels

begin their flight



Tonight

all sing

Oh, angels,

a new-born king

Tonight

all sing

Oh, angels

a new-born king
