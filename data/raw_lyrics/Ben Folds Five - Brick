6 am day after Christmas
I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold

Car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping
I am numb



Up the stairs to her apartment

She is balled up on the couch

Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte

they're not home to find us out

And we drive



Now that I have found someone

I'm feeling more alone

Than I ever have before

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly



they call her name at 7:30

I pace around the parking lot

then I walk down to buy her flowers

And sell some gifts that I got

Can't you see

It's not me you're dying for

Now she's feeling more alone

Then she ever has before



She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly

off the coast and I'm headed nowhere

She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly



As weeks went by

It showed that she was not fine

They told me son it's time to tell the truth

She broke down and I broke down

Cause I was tired of lying



Driving back to her apartment

For the moment we're alone

She's alone

I'm alone

Now I know it
