They were sitting
They were sitting in the strawberry swing
Every moment was so precious


They were sitting
They were talking in the strawberry swing

Everybody was for fighting

Wouldn't wanna waste a thing



Cold, cold water

Bring me round

Now my feet won't touch the ground

Cold, cold water

What ya say?

It's such

It's such a perfect day

It's such a perfect day



I remember

We were walking up to strawberry swing

I can't wait 'til the morning

Wouldn't wanna change a thing



People leaving all the time

Inside a perfectly straight line

Don't you wanna curve away

It's such

It's such a perfect day

It's such a perfect day



Now the sky could be blue

I don't mind

Without you it's a waste of time

could be blue

I don't mind

Without you it's a waste of time

could be blue

Could be grey

Without you it's a waste of time

could be blue

I don't mind

Without you it's a waste of time
