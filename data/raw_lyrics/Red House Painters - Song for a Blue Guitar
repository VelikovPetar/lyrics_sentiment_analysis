when everything we felt failed
and some music soft in distant sails
but it don't sound like it did before

then i know i'm left with nothing more
than my own soul
when pretty pictues face back

but your coats aren't hanging on the rack

and blue water turns to

a place that i can't get to

a place that i can't

in a room all i feel

is the cold that you left

through the air all i see

is your face full of blame

what's left to see

what's there to see



in the room all i feel

is the cold that you left

through the air all i see

is your face full of blame

what's left to see

what's there to see

what's left to see
