First, when there's nothing but a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide deep inside your mind
All alone I have cried, silent tears full of pride

In a world made of steel, made of stone
Well, I hear the music close my eyes, feel the rhythm

Wrap around, take a hold of my heart



What a feeling, being's believin'

I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life

Take your passion and make it happen

Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life



Now, I hear the music, close my eyes I am rhythm, 

wrap around take hold of my heart



What a feeling, being's believin'

I can have it all, now I'm dancing for my life

Take your passion and make it happen

Pictures come alive, now I'm dancing through my life

What a feeling



What a feeling

(I am music now)

Being's believin'

(I am rhythm now)

Pictures come alive, you can dance right through your life



What a feeling

(I can really have it all)

What a feeling

(Pictures come alive when I call)

I can have it all

(I can really have it all)

Have it all

(Pictures come alive when I call)



Call, call, call, call, what a feeling

(I can have it all)

Being's believin'

(Being's believin')

Take your passion, make it happen

(Make it happen)

What a feeling
