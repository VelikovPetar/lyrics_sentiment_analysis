I used to walk between the shadows
Lost in a world that grew too fast
I was afraid I'd always be alone
Then I saw your face at last

I found my way even in the dark there were times it seemed too far
I knew if I listen to my heart I found that love is where you are

I close my eyes and see tomorrow
My dreams begin and end with you
I hear you say you'd be there, always be there
I must believe it's true

I found my way even in the dark there were times it seemed too far 
I knew if I listen to my heart I found that love is where you are

Love is where you are and anywhere you are 
Is where I want to be
No matter what will happen
No matter where I go
Your arms are hope to me

I found my way even in the dark there were times it seemed too far
Somehow I knew even at first sight
That love is anywhere you are
Love is where you are
Love is where you are
