Nightmare
Now your nightmare comes to life.


Dragged you down below
Down to the devils show

To be his guest forever

Peace of mind is less than never



Hate to twist your mind

But God ain't on your side

An old acquaintance severed

Burn the world your last endeavor



Flesh is burning

You can smell it in the air

Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal



So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head

Your now a slave until the end of time here



Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare

While your nightmare comes to life



Can't wake up in sweat

Cause it ain't over yet

Still dancing with your demons

Victim of your own creation



Beyond the will to fight

Where all that's wrong is right

Where hate don't need a reason

Loathing self-assassination



You've been lied to

Just to rape you of your sight

And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel



So sedated as they medicate your brain

And while you slowly go insane they tell ya

"Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications"



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yeah

No one to call

Everybody to fear

Your tragic fate

Is looking so clear

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare



(Break)



(Maniacal laughter)

Fight. not to fail

Not to fall

Or you'll end up like the others



Die, die again

Drenched in sin

With no respect for another



Down, feel the fire

Feel the hate

Your pain is what we desire



Lost, hit the wall

Watch you crawl

Such a replaceable liar



And I know your hear their voices

Calling from above

And I know they may seem real

These signals of love

But our life's made up of choices

Some without appeal

They took for granted your soul

And it's ours now to steal



As your nightmare comes to life



You should have known

The price of evil

And it hurts to know that you belong here

Yea

No one to call

Everybody to fear

Your tragic fate

Is looking so clear

Yeah

Oooooooh

It's your fucking nightmare
