Here we are folks, the dream we all dream of 
Boy versus girl in the World Series of love 
Tell me, have U got the look? 


U walked in, I woke up 
I've never seen a pretty girl look so tough 

Baby, U got that look 



Color U peach and black 

Color me takin' aback 

Crucial, I think I wantcha 



U've got the look, U've got the hook 

Sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book 

Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin' 

If love is good, let's get 2 rammin' 

U got the look, U got the look 



Looka here 

U got the look (U got the look) 

U must'a took (U must'a took) 

A whole hour just 2 make up your face, baby 



Closin' time, ugly lights, everybody's inspected (Everybody's inspected) 

But U are a natural beauty unaffected (Unaffected) 

Did I say an hour? My face is red, I stand corrected (I stand corrected) 



U've got the look (U've got the look) 

U sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book (Slammin'!) 

Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin' 

If love is good, let's get 2 rammin' 

U got the look, U got the look 



There's no jokin' U 

Well, here we are 

Ladies and gentlemen, the dream we all dream of (Oh please!) 

Boy versus girl in the World Series of love 

Slammin'! 



U walked in (I walked in), I woke up (U woke up) 

I never seen such a pretty girl look so tough 

Baby (Baby), U got that look (U got that look) 

Yes U do (Yes U do) 



Color U peach and black 

Color me takin' aback, baby 

Crucial, I think I wantcha 



U've got the look, U've got the hook 

U sho'nuff do be cookin' in my book 

Your face is jammin', your body's heck-a-slammin' 

If your love is good, let's get 2 rammin' ... now! 

U got the look, U got the look 



Here we are folks, the dream we all dream of
