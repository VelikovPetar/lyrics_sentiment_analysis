You're my morning star
Shining brightly beside me
And if we keep this love

We will last through all eternity
Just the way we are I love it, love it
It's just the way it should be



'Cause our love will stand tall as the trees

Our love will spread wide as the seas

Our love will shine bright in the night

Like the stars above

And we'll always be together, our love



My love is surely one thing

You can surely depend on

In times of darkness and fear

I go to you

I know you'll make me strong

You're gonna make me happy

You're gonna make me smile



'Cause our love will stand tall as the trees

Our love will be for the whole world to see

Our love will change people's wrongs to right

And we will never die

'Cause we'll always have each other, our love



Our love will stand tall as the trees

Our love will spread as wide as the seas

Our love will shine bright in the night

Like the stars above

And we'll always be together



Our love, yeah, our love

We got a good old fashioned love

Hey, hey baby, our love
