All the single ladies. all the single ladies...
Now put your hands up
Up in the club, just broke up

I'm doing my own little thing
He decided to dip, but now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me

I'm up on him, he up on me

Don't pay him any attention

Cried my tears, for three good years

Ya can't be mad at me



Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Don't be mad once you see that he want it

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Ooo, ooooo, oooo



Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Don't be mad once you see that he want it

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Ooo, ooooo, oooo



I put gloss on my lips, a man on my hips

Fit me tighter than my in my Dereon jeans

Acting up, drank in my cup

I could care less what you think

I need no permission, did I mention

Don't pay him any attention

Cause you had your turn

But now you gonna learn

What it really feels to miss me



Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Don't be mad once you see that he want it

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Ooo, ooooo, oooo



Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Don't be mad once you see that he want it

If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

Ooo, ooooo, oooo



Don't treat me 2 the things of the world

I'm not that kind of girl

Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve

He's a man that makes me then takes me

And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond

Pull me into your arms

Say I'm the one you want

If you don't, you'll be alone

Like a ghost I'll be gone
