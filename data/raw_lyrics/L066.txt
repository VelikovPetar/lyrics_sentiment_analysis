In the twilight glow i see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain 
When we kissed goodbye and parted 

I knew we'd never meet again 
Love is like a dying ember 

And only memories remain 

And through the ages i'll remember 

Blue eyes crying in the rain.



Someday when we meet up yonder 

We'll stroll hand in hand again 

In the land that knows no parting

For blue eyes crying in the rain
