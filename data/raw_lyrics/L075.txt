Uh!
Ah!
Come on, uh, uh huh
But they don't hear me though
Uh, but they don't hear me though,
Uh, but they don't but they don't...

I got blood on my hands and there's no remorse
I got blood on my dick 'cause I fucked a corpse
I'm a nasty nigga when you pass me nigga look me in my eyes
Tell me to my fuckin' face that you ready to die
U be a dead mutha fucka red mutha fucka
Don't be stupid you heard what I said mutha fucka
Who shot you oh nigga like you don't know
Stickin you for your doe while I'm fuckin' your broke ho
Yo don't you get the picture niggaz can't touch me
'Cause I don't give a fuck G I'll get you touched B
I got choice ripple my slug'll take apart a door
And enuf crazy niggaz behind me to start a war
So what you want nigga help me is about your best
When I'm finished Red Cross couldn't clean up the mess
And a vest will do nothin' but make you look a little thicker
'Cause in the dark you ain't nothin' but a lil nigga
But if you've been thinkin' about that shit you did
You wouldn't have brought the joint wit you kid
Now I might have to get you kid and split your wig wit a machedi
I bring beef to niggaz and string them out like spaghetti
U ain't ready lord can you stand how I'm bringin' it
I'm givin' it is how I'm livin' it so I'm swingin' it
Red dot on your head 'cause you's in mid range
Red dot on your chest opens up your rib cage

I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through

Now if your heart wuz as big as your mouth you'd be real
But it's not so I know if you get knocked you'll squeal
Like a bitch 'cause you iz a bitch and always been a bitch
And you know how niggaz do a bitch we run up in a bitch
For somethin' in a bitch nigga do you know nigga do you owe me
Figure you could blow me well I'ma let this trigga feel you homey
That niggaz got to be smokin' somethin' thinkin' you chokin somethin'
Fuckin' around wit me you'll be a broken somethin'
I'm out for blood wit the crypts at war
How much shit could you talk wit your lips on the floor
Pussy niggaz make me itch so I scratch you's a bitch
So I snatch up your face fake ass bitch so I scratch u
Yeah... There was a time when I would have jumped up and choked this nigga
But now I'm on some shit like... Yo... smoke this nigga
I'm bout to find out how much guts you got before I spill em
Somebody come and get this mutha fucka before I kill em
Ah!.. fresh out the asylum I'm wylin
Y'all niggaz know the phone number for help you best ta dial them
9-1-1 emergency the urgency
We'll have witnesses seein what the surgeon see
How far you gonna get wit your dome split fool
Or catch your man strippin 'cause he think his shape cool
But it ain't so I paint the walls wit his blood
Another dick in the mud
Nigga what!

I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through

Ah you you know who this is for, they let the doggs in the door
Ah you you know who this is for, they let the doggs in the door
