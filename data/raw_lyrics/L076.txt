Met a girl, thought she was grand
fell in love, found out first hand
went well for a week or two

then it all came unglued
in a trapped trip I can't grip

never thought I'd be the one who'd slip

then I started to realize

I was living one big lie



She fucking hates me

trust

she fucking hates me

la la la love

I tried too hard

and she tore my feelings like I had none

and ripped them away



She was queen for about an hour

after that shit got sour

she took all I ever had

no sign of guilt

no feeling of bad, no



In a trapped trip I can't grip 

never thought i'd be the one who'd slip

then I started to realize

I was living one big lie



She fucking hates me

trust

she fucking hates me

la la la love

I tried too hard

and she tore my feelings like I had none

and ripped them away



that's my story, as you see

learned my lesson and so did she

now it's over and i'm glad 

'cause i'm a fool for all i've said



She fucking hates me

trust

she fucking hates me

la la la love

I tried too hard

and she tore my feelings like I had none

and ripped them away



la la la la la la la la la love

Trust

la la la la la la la la la love

Trust

and she tore my feelings like I had none

she fucking hates me
