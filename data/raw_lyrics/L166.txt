You put the boom-boom into my heart ([Sam and New Directions:] Do, do!)
You send my soul sky high when your lovin' starts
A jitterbug into my brain ([Sam and New Directions:] Yeah, yeah!)
It goes a (bang-bang-bang) 'til my feet do the same

(Ah, ah) But something's bugging me
(Ah, ah) Something ain't right
(Ah, ah) My best friend told me
(Ah, ah) what you did last night
(Ah, ah) You left me sleeping
(Ah, ah) in my bed
(Ah, ah) I was dreaming, but

I should have been with you instead

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
'Cause I'm not plannin' on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go whoa

Take me dancing tonight
I wanna hit that high yeah, yeah

You take the grey skies out of my way ([Sam and New Directions:] Do, do)
You make the sun shine brighter than Doris Day
You turned a bright spark into a flame ([Sam and New Directions:] Yeah, yeah)
My (beats per minute) never been the same

(Ah, ah) 'Cause you're my lady,
(Ah, ah) I'm your fool
(Ah, ah) It makes me crazy
(Ah, ah) when you act so cruel
(Ah, ah) Come on, baby,
(Ah, ah) let's not fight
(Ah, ah) We'll go dancing,

Everything will be all right

Wake me up before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
Wake me up before you go-go
I don't want to miss it when you hit that high
Wake me up before you go-go
Cause I'm not planning on going solo
Wake me up before you go-go whoa

Take me dancing tonight
