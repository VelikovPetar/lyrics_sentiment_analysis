In the town where i was born, lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life, in the land of submarine
So we sailed up to the sun til we found the sea of green

And we lived beneath the waves in on yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine 

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all on board

Many more of them live nex door

And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine 

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine 

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

As we live a life of easy

Every one of us has all we need

Sky of blue and sea of green

In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine 

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine 

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine 

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine 

Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
