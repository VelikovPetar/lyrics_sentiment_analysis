I'm just a lonely boy, lonely and blue
I'm all alone with nothin' to do
I've got everything you could think of

But all I want is someone to love
Someone, yes, someone to love, someone to kiss
Someone to hold at a moment like this

I'd like to hear somebody say

"I'll give you my love each night and day"

Somebody, somebody, somebody, please send her to me

I'll make her happy, just wait and see

I prayed so hard to the heavens above

That I might find someone to love
